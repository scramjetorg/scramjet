## What does it do?

Scramjet is a powerful, yet simple framework written on top of node.js object streams, somewhat similar to the
well-known [event-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/event-stream) or
[highland](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highland) module, but with a much simplier API and written fully in ES6. It is
built upon the logic behind three well known javascript array operations - namingly map, filter and reduce. This means
that if you've ever performed operations on an Array in JavaScript - you already know Scramjet like the back of your
hand.

The main advantage of scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams. First of all it allows you to
perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your
stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

The benchmarks are punblished in the [scramjet-benchmark repo](https://github.com/signicode/scramjet-benchmark).

## Example

How about a CSV parser of all the parkings in the city of WrocÅ‚aw from http://www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/...

```javascript
const request = require("request");
const StringStream = require("scramjet").StringStream;

let columns = null;
request.get("http://www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/opendata/its/parkingi/parkingi.csv")
    .pipe(new StringStream())
    .split("\n")
    .parse((line) => line.split(";"))
    .pop(1, (data) => columns = data)
    .map((data) => columns.reduce((acc, id, i) => (acc[id] = data[i], acc), {}))
    .on("data", console.log.bind(console))
```

## API Docs

Here's the list of the exposed classes, please review the specific documentation for details:

* [```scramjet.DataStream```](docs/data-stream.md) - the base class for all scramjet classes.
* [```scramjet.BufferStream```](docs/buffer-stream.md) - a DataStream of Buffers.
* [```scramjet.StringStream```](docs/string-stream.md) - a DataStream of Strings.
* [```scramjet.MultiStream```](docs/multi-stream.md) - a DataStream of Strings.

Note that:

* Most of the methods take a callback argument that operates on the stream items.
* The callback, unless it's stated otherwise, will receive an argument with the next chunk.
* If you want to perform your operations asynchronously, return a Promise, otherwise just return the right value.

## Browserifying

Scramjet works in the browser too, there's a nice, self-contained sample in here, just run it:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/signicode/scramjet.git
    cd scramjet
    npm install .
    cd samples/browser
    npm start # point your browser to http://localhost:30035 and open console
```

If you need your scramjet version for the browser, grab browserify and just run:

```bash
    browserify lib/index -standalone scramjet -o /path/to/your/browserified-scramjet.js
```

With this you can run your transformations in the browser, use websockets to send them back and forth. If you do and fail for some reason, please remember to be issuing those issues - as no one person can test all the use cases and I am but one person.

## Usage

Scramjet uses functional programming to run transformations on your data streams in a fashion very similar to the well known event-stream node module. Most transformations are done by passing a transform function. You can write your function in two ways:

1. Synchronous

 Example: a simple stream transform that outputs a stream of objects of the same id property and the length of the value string.

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => ({id: item.id, length: item.value.length})
    )
 ```

2. Asynchronous (using Promises)

 Example: A simple stream that fetches an url mentioned in the incoming object

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            request(item.url, (err, res, data) => {
                if (err)
                    reject(err); // will emit an "error" event on the stream
                else
                    resolve(data);
            });
        })
    )
 ```

The actual logic of this transform function is as if you passed your function
to the ```then``` method of a Promise resolved with the data from the input
stream.

## Help wanted

The project need's your help! There's lots of work to do - transforming and muxing, joining and splitting, browserifying, modularizing, documenting and issuing those issues.
