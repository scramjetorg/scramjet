## What does it do?

Scramjet is a fast, simple, multi-threaded functional stream programming framework written on top of node.js object
streams. It exposes a standards inspired javascript API and written fully in native ES6. Thanks to it some built in
optimizations scramjet is much faster and much much simpler than similar frameworks when using asynchronous operations.

It is built upon the logic behind three well known javascript array operations - namingly map, filter and reduce. This
means that if you've ever performed operations on an Array in JavaScript - you already know Scramjet like the back of
your hand.

The main advantage of scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams. First of all it allows you to
perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your
stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

The benchmarks are published in the [scramjet-benchmark repo](https://github.com/signicode/scramjet-benchmark).

## Example

How about a full API to API migration, reading a long list of items from one API and checking them one after another,
pushing them to another API? With simultaneous request control? And outputting the log of the conversion? Easy!

```javascript
const request = require("request");
const rp = require("request-promise-native");
const { StringStream } = require("scramjet");

StringStream.from(                                 // fetch your API to a scramjet stream
        request('https://api.example.org/v1/shows/list')
    )
    .setOptions({maxParallel: 4})                  // set your options
    .lines()                                       // split the stream by line
    .parse(theirShow => {                          // parse to your requirement
        return {
            id: theirShow.id,
            title: theirShow.name,
            url: theirShow.url
        }
    })
    .map(myShow => rp({                            // parse to your requirement
        method: "POST",
        simple: true,
        uri: `http://api.local/set/${myshow.id}`,
        body: JSON.stringify(myShow)
    })
    .map(resp => `+ Update succeeded ${err.uri}`)  // make your logs
    .catch(err => `! Error occured ${err.uri}`)
    .append('\n')
    .pipe(process.stdout);                         // pipe to any output
```

Of course you can also use the simple `CSVParse` method to do that. :)

## Usage

Scramjet uses functional programming to run transformations on your data streams in a fashion very similar to the well
known event-stream node module. Most transformations are done by passing a transform function. You can write your
function in three ways:

1. Synchronous

 Example: a simple stream transform that outputs a stream of objects of the same id property and the length of the value string.

 ```javascript
DataStream
    .from(items)
    .map(
        (item) => ({id: item.id, length: item.value.length})
    )
 ```

2. Asynchronous using ES2015 async await

Example: A simple stream that uses `Fetch API` to get all the contents of all entries in the stream

```javascript
StringStream
    .from(urls)
    .map(
        async (url) => fetch(url).then(res => res.json())
    )
    .JSONParse()
```

3. Asynchronous using Promises

 Example: A simple stream that fetches an url mentioned in the incoming object

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            request(item.url, (err, res, data) => {
                if (err)
                    reject(err); // will emit an "error" event on the stream
                else
                    resolve(data);
            });
        })
    )
 ```

The actual logic of this transform function is as if you passed your function to the `then` method of a Promise
resolved with the data from the input stream.

4. Streams with multi-threading

To distribute your code among the processor cores, just use the method ```distribute```:

 ```javascript
    datastream.distribute(
        16, // number of threads
        (stream) => {
            // multi-threaded code goes here.
            // it MUST return a valid stream back to the main thread.
        }
    )
 ```

## Typescript support

Scramjet aims to be fully documented and expose TypeScript declarations. First version to include  definitions in `.d.ts`
folder is 4.15.0. More TypeScript support will be added with next versions, so feel free to report issues in GitHub.

## Detailed docs

Here's the list of the exposed classes and methods, please review the specific documentation for details:

* [```scramjet```](docs/index.md) - module exports explained
* [```scramjet.DataStream```](docs/data-stream.md) - the base class for all scramjet classes, object stream.
* [```scramjet.BufferStream```](docs/buffer-stream.md) - a stream of Buffers.
* [```scramjet.StringStream```](docs/string-stream.md) - a stream of Strings.
* [```scramjet.NumberStream```](docs/number-stream.md) - a stream of Numbers
* [```scramjet.MultiStream```](docs/multi-stream.md) - A group of streams (for multi-threading and muxing).
* [more on plugins](docs/plugins.md) - a description and link.

Note that:

* Most of the methods take a callback argument that operates on the stream items.
* The callback, unless it's stated otherwise, will receive an argument with the next chunk.
* If you want to perform your operations asynchronously, return a Promise, otherwise just return the right value.

## CLI

Check out the command line interface for simplified scramjet usage with [scramjet-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet-cli)

## Scramjet core

Don't like dependencies? Scramjet packs just a couple of those, but if you are really really annoyed by second depth of
deps, please try [scramjet-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet-core).

Only the most vital methods there, but the library is dependency free.

As of version 2.0 Scramjet is MIT Licensed.

## Help wanted

The project need's your help! There's lots of work to do - transforming and muxing, joining and splitting, browserifying, modularizing, documenting and issuing those issues.
