# Scramjet.org - Serverless data computing
Welcome to the Scramjet.org GitHub organisation page!

We're a deep tech startup and a team of IT enthusiasts building products meant for serverless stream processing, data pipelines and other workflows.

Our current GitHub repositories here are related to two main products:

# Scramjet Transform Hub

<img src="./images/transform-hub.svg" width="37%" alt="Scramjet Framework Logo" />

Data processing engine which allows you to deploy and run multiple data processing apps called sequences. It can be treated both as data execution platform for multiple sequences running on the same platform and performing various data processing tasks. You will be able to start programs in the background or connect to them and see their output directly on your terminal. You will be able to pipe your local data to the program as if it was running from your terminal. You can start your server in AWS, Google Cloud or Azure, start it on your local machine, install it on a Rasperry Pi or wherever else you'd like.

Main repository for Scramjet Transform Hub is [scramjetorg/transform-hub](scramjetorg/transform-hub). 

We have also repository with simple intoductory Readme and code samples here [scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs)

You can also find Scramjet Transform Hub packages on NPM: [npmjs.com/package/@scramjet/sth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scramjet/sth) and [npmjs.com/package/@scramjet/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scramjet/cli)

# Scramjet Framework
<img src="./images/framework.svg" width="33%" alt="Scramjet Framework Logo" />
&nbsp;

Fast, simple, functional reactive stream programming framework written on top of node.js object streams. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and reduce and fully compatible with ES7 async/await. Thanks to it some built in optimizations scramjet is much faster and much much simpler than similar frameworks when using asynchronous operations.

Main repository for Scramjet framework is [scramjetorg/scramjet](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet). 

You can also find Scramjet Framework package on NPM [npmjs.com/package/scramjet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet)
