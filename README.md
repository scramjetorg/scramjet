## What does it do?

Scramjet is a fast, simple, functional reactive stream programming framework written on top of node.js object
streams. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and
reduce and fully compatible with ES7 async/await. Thanks to it some built in optimizations scramjet is much faster and much
much simpler than similar frameworks when using asynchronous operations.

The main advantage of scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams. First of all it allows you to
perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your
stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively. And if you're after some heavy maths
there's an option of running your stream as multi-threaded!

The benchmarks are published in the [scramjet-benchmark repo](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-benchmark).

**We are working on the next version of Scramjet Framework and are very eager for your feedback! You can see and test `pre-v5` JavaScript/TypeScript version in [scramjeorg/framework-js](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-js) repository and a brand new Python version in [scramjeorg/framework-python](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-python)!**

## Example

How about a full API to API migration, reading a long list of items from one API and checking them one after another,
pushing them to another API? With simultaneous request control? And outputting the log of the conversion? Easy!

```javascript
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
const get = async (url, options = {}) => (await fetch(url, options)).json;
const { StringStream } = require("scramjet");

StringStream.from(                                 // fetch your API to a scramjet stream
    () => get("https://api.example.org/v1/shows/list")
)
    .setOptions({maxParallel: 4})                  // set your options
    .lines()                                       // split the stream by line
    .parse(line => {                               // parse strings to data
        const [id, title, url] = line.split(",");
        return { id, title, url };
    })
    .map(async myShow => get({                      // use asynchronous mapping (for example send requests)
        uri: `http://api.local/set/${myShow.id}`,
        body: JSON.stringify(myShow)
    }))
    .stringify(resp => `+ Updated "${resp}"`)
    .catch(err => `! Error occured ${err.uri}`)    // handle errors
    .append("\n")
    .pipe(process.stdout)                          // use any stream
;

```

Here you can find a most basic guide on how to execute the above example starting from just having access to some command
line: [Scramjet from Scratch](./docs/scramjet-from-scratch.md)

## Execution and deployment

You can now run stream processing programs with our Scramjet Transform Hub. It will allow you to deploy and execute programs
on local and remote environments of your choice and it's as easy as:

```sh
npm i -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli
scramjet-transform-hub &
si run <path-to-your-program-dir>
```

See more info:

* onour website [scramjet.org](https://scramjet.org),
* the documentation repo [scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs)
* the source code and development guide [scramjetorg/transform-hub](https://github.com/scramjetorg/transform-hub)

## Usage

Scramjet uses functional programming to run transformations on your data streams in a fashion
very similar to the well known event-stream node module. First create a stream from a source:

Use `DataStream.from(someThing)` to create a new stream from an Array, Generator, AsyncGenerator,
Iterator or Readable stream. See the [DataStream.from docs](docs/data-stream.md#DataStream.from)
for more information, here's a sample.

```javascript
/* global StringStream, fs */
StringStream
    .from(fs.createReadStream("./log.txt"))     // get from any readable stream
    .lines()                                 // split the stream by line
    .use("./your-file")                      // use some transforms from another file
;

```

Use `DataStream.pipeline(readable, transforms)` to create a pipeline of transform streams and/or
stream modules. Any number of consecutive arguments will get piped one into another.

```javascript
/* global StringStream, fs, gzip */
StringStream
    .pipeline(                              // process a number of streams
        fs.createReadStream("./log.txt.gz"),
        gzip.unzip()                        // all errors here will get forwarded
    )
    .lines()                                // split the stream by line
    .use("./your-file")                     // use some transforms from another file
;

```

Some methods like `from`, `use`, `flatMap` allow using ES6 generators and ES7 async generators:

```javascript
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
const { StringStream } = require("scramjet");

StringStream
    .from(
        async function* () {                       // construct a stream from an async generator
            yield "houses\n";                      // yield - push a stream chunk
                                                   // yield - push a whole stream
            yield* (await fetch("https://example.org/categories")).body;
        },
        {maxParallel: 4}                           // set your options
    )
    .lines()                                       // split the stream by line
    .flatMap(async function* (category) {
        const req = await fetch(`https://example.org/posts/${category}/`);
        yield* await req.json();                   // yield - push a whole array
    })
    .catch(err => `! Error occured ${err.uri}`)
    .toStringStream()
    .append("\n")
    .pipe(process.stdout)   // pipe to any output
;

```

Most transformations are done by passing a transform function. You can write your function in three ways:

1. Synchronous

Example: a simple stream transform that outputs a stream of objects of the same id property and the length of the value string.

 ```javascript
DataStream
    .from(items)
    .map(
        (item) => ({id: item.id, length: item.value.length})
    )
 ```

2. Asynchronous using ES2015 async await

Example: A simple stream that uses `Fetch API` to get all the contents of all entries in the stream

```javascript
StringStream
    .from(urls)
    .map(
        async (url) => fetch(url).then(res => res.json())
    )
    .JSONParse()
```

3. Asynchronous using Promises

 Example: A simple stream that fetches an url mentioned in the incoming object

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            request(item.url, (err, res, data) => {
                if (err)
                    reject(err); // will emit an "error" event on the stream
                else
                    resolve(data);
            });
        })
    )
 ```

The actual logic of this transform function is as if you passed your function to the `then` method of a Promise
resolved with the data from the input stream.

4. Streams with multi-threading

To distribute your code among the processor cores, just use the method ```distribute```:

 ```javascript
    datastream.distribute(
        16, // number of threads
        (stream) => {
            // multi-threaded code goes here.
            // it MUST return a valid stream back to the main thread.
        }
    )
 ```

## Writing modules

Scramjet allows writing simple modules that are resolved in the same way as node's `require`. A module
is a simple javascript file that exposes a function taking a stream and any number of following arguments
as default export.

Here's an example:

```javascript
module.exports = (stream, arg1) => {
    const mapper = (chunk) => mapper(chunk, arg1);
    return stream.map(mapper);
}
```

Then it can be used with `DataStream.use` function like this:

```javascript
myStream.use("./path/to/my-module", "arg1");
```

If these modules are published you can also simply use `myStream.use("published-module")`.

For more universal modules you can use helper methods `createTransformModule` and `createReadModule` that scramjet exports. See more in about this in this blog post [Scramjet Modules](https://www.scramjet.org/posts/modules).

## Typescript support

Scramjet aims to be fully documented and expose TypeScript declarations. First version to include  definitions in `.d.ts`
folder is 4.15.0. More TypeScript support will be added with next versions, so feel free to report issues in GitHub.

## Detailed docs

Here's the list of the exposed classes and methods, please review the specific documentation for details:

* [```scramjet```](docs/index.md) - module exports explained
* [```scramjet.DataStream```](docs/data-stream.md) - the base class for all scramjet classes, object stream.
* [```scramjet.BufferStream```](docs/buffer-stream.md) - a stream of Buffers.
* [```scramjet.StringStream```](docs/string-stream.md) - a stream of Strings.
* [```scramjet.NumberStream```](docs/number-stream.md) - a stream of Numbers
* [```scramjet.MultiStream```](docs/multi-stream.md) - A group of streams (for multi-threading and muxing).
* [more on plugins](docs/plugins.md) - a description and link.

Note that:

* Most of the methods take a Function argument that operates on the stream items.
* The Function, unless it's stated otherwise, will receive an argument with the next chunk.
* If you want to perform your operations asynchronously, return a Promise, otherwise just return the right value.

## CLI

Check out the command line interface for simplified scramjet usage with [scramjet-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet-cli)

    $ sjr -i http://datasource.org/file.csv ./transform-module-1 ./transform-module-1 | gzip > logs.gz

## Quick reference of some methods

### :DataStream
DataStream is the primary stream type for Scramjet. When you parse your
stream, just pipe it you can then perform calculations on the data objects
streamed through your flow.

Use as:

```javascript
const { DataStream } = require('scramjet');

await (DataStream.from(aStream) // create a DataStream
    .map(findInFiles)           // read some data asynchronously
    .map(sendToAPI)             // send the data somewhere
    .run());                    // wait until end
```

### :BufferStream
A facilitation stream created for easy splitting or parsing buffers.

Useful for working on built-in Node.js streams from files, parsing binary formats etc.

A simple use case would be:

```javascript
 fs.createReadStream('pixels.rgba')
     .pipe(new BufferStream)         // pipe a buffer stream into scramjet
     .breakup(4)                     // split into 4 byte fragments
     .parse(buffer => [
         buffer.readInt8(0),            // the output is a stream of R,G,B and Alpha
         buffer.readInt8(1),            // values from 0-255 in an array.
         buffer.readInt8(2),
         buffer.readInt8(3)
     ]);
```

### :MultiStream
An object consisting of multiple streams than can be refined or muxed.

The idea behind a MultiStream is being able to mux and demux streams when needed.

Usage:
```javascript
new MultiStream([...streams])
 .mux();

new MultiStream(function*(){ yield* streams; })
 .map(stream => stream.filter(myFilter))
 .mux();
```

### :NumberStream
Simple scramjet stream that by default contains numbers or other containing with `valueOf` method. The streams
provides simple methods like `sum`, `average`. It derives from DataStream so it's still fully supporting all `map`,
`reduce` etc.

[Detailed :NumberStream docs here](docs/number-stream.md)

**Most popular methods:**

* `new NumberStream(options)` - Creates an instance of NumberStream.
* [`numberStream.sum() : Promise.<number> | any ⇄`](docs/number-stream.md#module_scramjet.NumberStream+sum) - Calculates the sum of all items in the stream.
* [`numberStream.avg() : Promise.<number> | any ⇄`](docs/number-stream.md#module_scramjet.NumberStream+avg) - Calculates the sum of all items in the stream.

### :WindowStream
A stream for moving window calculation with some simple methods.

In essence it's a stream of Array's containing a list of items - a window.
It's best used when created by the `DataStream..window`` method.

[Detailed :WindowStream docs here](docs/window-stream.md)

**Most popular methods:**

* [`windowStream.sum([valueOf]) : NumberStream ↺`](docs/window-stream.md#module_scramjet.WindowStream+sum) - Calculates moving sum of items, the output NumberStream will contain the moving sum.
* [`windowStream.avg([valueOf]) : NumberStream ↺`](docs/window-stream.md#module_scramjet.WindowStream+avg) - Calculates the moving average of the window and returns the NumberStream

### :StreamWorker
StreamWorker class - intended for internal use

This class provides control over the subprocesses, including:
 - spawning
 - communicating
 - delivering streams

**Most popular methods:**

* `new StreamWorker()` - Private constructor
* [`streamWorker.spawn() : StreamWorker ⇄`](docs/stream-worker.md#module_scramjet.StreamWorker+spawn) - Spawns the worker if necessary and provides the port information to it.
* [`streamWorker.delegate(input, delegateFunc, [plugins]) : DataStream`](docs/stream-worker.md#module_scramjet.StreamWorker+delegate) - Delegates a stream to the child using tcp socket.
* [`StreamWorker:fork([count]) : Array.<StreamWorker> ⇄`](docs/stream-worker.md#module_scramjet.StreamWorker.fork) - Spawns (Preforks) a given number of subprocesses and returns the worker asynchronously.
* [`StreamWorker:_getWorker() : StreamWorker ⇄`](docs/stream-worker.md#module_scramjet.StreamWorker._getWorker) - Picks next worker (not necessarily free one!)



## Scramjet core

Don't like dependencies? Scramjet packs just a couple of those, but if you are really really annoyed by second depth of
deps, please try [scramjet-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet-core).

Only the most vital methods there, but the library is dependency free.
